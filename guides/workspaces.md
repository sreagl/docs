# Workspace organization

Don't know how to set up your Coder workspaces? We're here to help.

In general, the fewer workspaces per developer, the easier it is for individual developers to manage. For teams that don't have a complex workflow, try starting with one workspace per developer. 

With more complex workflows, you may need to support multiple projects, each potentially with its own language, set of tooling, and dependencies. In this scenario, a different type of Coder environment could be more helpful. Use the table below to see  pros and cons of each option.

| One workspace... | Description | Benefits | Caveats |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| Per developer | With one workspace per developer, think of the Coder workspace the way you would a laptop: the workspace is where you have all of your languages, dependencies, and tooling installed, and it is the one place you go to work on projects. This is best for simple workflows. | ‚úÖ Fewer workspaces to manage </br>‚úÖ No switching between workspaces for different projects | ‚ùå Size of the workspace can become large </br> ‚ùå Image supporting such a workspace can become complex |
| Per architecture | Imagine this as one workspace for your JavaScript projects, one workspace for your Python projects, and so on. This is best for workflows with using several different architectures. | ‚úÖ Smaller images because they only contain one language and its dependencies | ‚ùå Developers need multiple workspaces, consuming more storage space overall |
| Per project per developer | In this environment, each developer has multiple workspaces, with each workspace devoted to one project. If a developer is working on three projects, they'd have three workspaces. This is best if devs tend to work on multiple projects simultaneously. | ‚úÖ Streamlined images with only the languages and dependencies included </br>‚úÖ Smaller, lighter workspaces | ‚ùå As the number of workspaces per developer grows, developers may spend too much personalizing workspaces </br>üí° Avoid this drawback with well-defined dotfiles | 
| Per major version of the project | A version of the "per project per developer" option is to use one workspace per **major** version of a project. This is best if devs are primarily working on multiple versions simultaneously. </br>üí° **Tip:** Coder allows you to change the underlying image, so you can update the image (changing out the language and any dependencies) if needed. | ‚úÖ Streamlined images with only the languages and dependencies included </br>‚úÖ Smaller, lighter workspaces | ‚ùå As the number of workspaces per developer grows, developers may spend too much personalizing workspaces </br>üí° Avoid this drawback with well-defined dotfiles | 
| Per feature or branch | Setting up one workspace per feature (or branch) allows developers to focus. This is best if devs primarily work on single features or branches rather than full projects. | ‚úÖ Allows developers to focus on a single feature </br> ‚úÖ Allows access to the work in progress with dev URLs (could replace preview builds) </br> ‚úÖ Push changes to the branch/pull request from their own workspace without needing access to primary developers' workspaces | ‚ùå Consumes more storage space | 
| Per commit | This is not a recommended workflow. | n/a | ‚ùå High cost of resources |
